# EPILEPTIC-SEIZURES-PREDICTION-USING-EEG-SIGNALS

We focus our analysis in the main aspects involved in the recognition process (e.g., subjects, features extracted, classifiers), and compare the works per them. 
We propose the emotional activation curve to demonstrate the activation process of emotions. 
The primary objective of this project was to improve the performance of emotion recognition using brain signals by applying a novel and adaptive channel selection method that acknowledges that brain activity has a unique behaviour that differs from one person to another and one emotional state to another. 

Problem statement
There has been much research done from EEG with different result. This different result has been due to diversity in different aspects of methods used in the research. 
The diversities are mainly in aspects of emotion selection, experiment environment, techniques of data pre-processing and feature selection.
The main objective of this project was to improve the performance of EEG using brain signals.
 To effectively classify and predict the seizures.
To enhance the performance of overall prediction result.
